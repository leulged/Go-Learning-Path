# Go Learning Path

This repository is a structured learning path for **Go (Golang)**, organized around practical tasks and projects to strengthen Go fundamentals and advanced concepts. Each folder represents a specific task or project that builds on previous lessons, following **Clean Architecture principles** where applicable.

## Structure

### Tasks & Projects
- `task1` – Basic Go exercises and learning tasks.  
- `task2` – Intermediate exercises including course validation and small business logic.  
- `user_management` – Simple user management system demonstrating CRUD operations.  
- `task_manager/task-manager` – Task management system implementing Clean Architecture, including services, controllers, and domain logic.  
- `library_management` – Library management system, documentation updated for learning purposes.  

### Features Covered
- Core Go syntax and concepts (variables, functions, structs, interfaces).  
- Error handling, testing, and logging.  
- Clean Architecture: domain, usecase, repository, and delivery layers.  
- CRUD operations using Go.  
- Project structuring for maintainability and scalability.  

## Learning Goals
- Understand and apply Go fundamentals in real-world tasks.  
- Implement software projects using **Clean Architecture principles**.  
- Gain hands-on experience in building APIs, managing data, and structuring code for large projects.  
- Improve problem-solving skills with Go through progressively complex tasks.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leulged/Go-Learning-Path.git
````

2. Navigate to a task folder:

   ```bash
   cd task1
   ```
3. Run the Go code using:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
4. Explore each project folder to learn new concepts and coding practices.
